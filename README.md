# Caesar-Cipher-Decoder
If cryptography interests you, then one of the greatcyber security project ideasfor you is to build an app to break a caesar cipher. Now, what is a caesar cipher? It is a type of encryption method wherein the letters of a given text are replaced by other letters that come after several other alphabets.

For example, if you encrypt the word ‘Software’ by shifting 3 alphabets, then the Caesar chipper for it will be ‘VRIWZDUH.’ So, you can start by building a web app to break such simple encryption; later on, move on to complex concepts. Your software interface should have a space for the input text, a drop option to choose the ‘Shift,’ and a space for the output text, which will be the cipher decoded text.
